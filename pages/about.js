          Probably the most demanding project I've ever had, the Banorte Hackathon was one of the best experiences I had sharing with several of my best friends, 
          friends who were and are part of the VOLTEC ROBOTICS 6647 team. In this challenge there was a focus on improving the experience of the user using the Banorte 
          portal using artificial intelligence. Tools such as Pytorch were used to generate a script that would allow knowing where the user's mouse position is to 
          determine the time it took to reach a portal service. As well as based on artificial intelligence, which will generate a new version of the Banorte portal 
          and determine how long it takes. If the AI made the process faster than the human, this user will receive an update from his portal so that he can make that 
          process faster. For the generation of web pages, a prototype of a new Banorte portal was created using Remix, a JavaScript framework and with additional tools 
          such as TailWind CSS and DaisyUI to generate friendlier and easier-to-use pages.

      This is my last project to date in which I participate in the FireFighting category. It consisted of building a 100% autonomous robot 
      that could put out candles that are at different heights and blocked by walls. Just like the sails were surrounded by black tape that 
      marked an area for the sails that could be used by sensors to align the robot. I participated with my team called Robotrix, made up mainly 
      of Mechatronic and Robotic Engineers. While they were mainly in charge of the function of motors and sensors, I personally was in charge of 
      implementing a pretrained model of object detection with YOLOv5 and using an NVIDIA Jetson to process video and that this would send signals 
      to the Arduino to move motors. The way in which I programmed it was using Python libraries such as Pytorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Ultralytics (in the beta phase) 
      and Pyserial (library in charge of communicating with the Arduino).
