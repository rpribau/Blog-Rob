# Hi! 👋  

Ever since I created the first version of this webpage back in mid-summer of 2023, I’ve wanted to start a blog to share my thoughts and knowledge with the public throughout 2025 and beyond. You might be wondering: *Why not just upload your content to LinkedIn or create a Medium account? You’d get more visibility, a broader audience, and wouldn’t have to spend time building this blog.*  

The short, yet somewhat complex answer is: **I don’t enjoy being on social media.** I don’t have an active social media profile at the moment, and even if you find me on Facebook or Instagram, I probably won’t respond anytime soon. The **only active social media you'll find me is on LinkedIn** and if I don't answer instantly, please give me some time and I'll answer you without any problem.

*The only reason I haven’t deleted my profiles is that I use Facebook to log in to certain apps… lol.*  

The main reason I even have LinkedIn is to find job opportunities. Additionally, it’s where I communicate with colleagues whose personal contact information I don’t have. I rarely check LinkedIn on my phone and typically only use it on my desktop or during “dead times” when there’s nothing else to do.  

## What Will I Post Here?  

In the coming weeks and months, I’ll be writing about:  

- Monthly updates on my projects.  
- Tutorials on what I’ve learned (Computer Vision, Web Development, Data Science, CUDA, etc.).  
- Personal opinions.  
- And much more!  

**As of writing this, I’m currently working on in-depth tutorials for OpenCV and CUDA, focusing on how they integrate with YOLO models and how you can implement them in various projects.**  

Stay tuned for more content.  

# Happy reading and stay safe out there! 🎉
