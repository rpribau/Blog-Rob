My current teammates that I love to being part :-)

## Overview

Vehiculos Autonomos No Tripulados del Tecnologico de Monterrey (Vanttec) is a robotics and research team at my university in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n. We focus on creating autonomous robots for research purposes and participate in robotics competitions such as Roboboat in Sarasota, Florida, USA. I joined in March 2024, and since then, I've been pursuing this activity as a hobby when free from academic responsibilities.

I'm currently working on the SDV (Self-Driving Vehicle) project, developing Computer Vision tools to help the vehicle understand its surrounding environment. My main goal is to rewrite existing Python code in C++ to improve performance. This includes creating new ROS2 nodes that control various parts of the SDV. While some parts of the code are **not available to the public yet**, several test implementations are accessible on my GitHub.
