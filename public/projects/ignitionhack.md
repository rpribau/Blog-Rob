In recent years México has been lagging behind in education. The long lasting effects of the pandemic has left students with complications during their learning experience, as most feel that they can't pay attention for long stints, and sadly this is not only a reality for México, as it also affects other countries, as The Guardian's article mentions "The survey of 504 primary and early years teachers in schools in England by the online subject resource Kapow Primary found that 84% agreed that children's attention span was “shorter than ever” post-Covid. Nearly two-thirds (69%) had noticed an increase in inattention and daydreaming".

This is why we decided to attack this problematic the innovative solution, study metrics, an AI SaaS that empowers teachers into creating new and innovative experiences for their students, all by the power for artificial intelligence as a data centric approach.

My main goal was to create face recognition tools using OpenCV with CUDA implemented using C++. Most of the code was already done, but the main improvement I made was to implement it for low-end devices that don't have a dedicated GPU, as most of the teachers in México don't have the resources to have a high-end device.
