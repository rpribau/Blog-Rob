In the first edition of the Hackathon Banorte, our challenge was to create a new website for Banorte with AI tools to help the clients to have a better understanding of their financial status. We developed a new and modern website with a new design and a new way to interact with the clients. But our main goal was to create a tool that could help Banorte to analyze how the clients are using the website and to give them a better experience by giving them a new updated website according to their needs.

This also was my very first time winning a hackathon, and I'm very proud of the work we did in just 24 hours. We used Python to create the AI tools and RemixJS to create the website. We also used TailWindCSS to style the website and Cloudflare to host the website. I was in charge of creating the new website and getting adviced on how to use RemixJS, since it was my first time using this framework. The website is not anymore available to the public, and the code isn't available to the public yet due to the NDA we signed with Banorte by entering the hackathon.
