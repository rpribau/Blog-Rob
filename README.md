# My Personal Portfolio and Blog

This is one hobby that I really wanted to develop mostly because I'm not good at communicate with a lot of people. Most of the times I prefer to stay quiet and don't say my opinion or even trying not to let people know about me. I'm not used to use Javascript (Js) nor Next.js or even using an UI tool such as Chakra UI, the main magic behind this webpage.

**Update 6/23/2024**

It's been almost a year that I have created my website and this last year a learned a lot of ChakraUI and the only thing I can say is one thing: **is WAY better than TailWindCSS** and every variant. I simply can stop recommend this library for web development. It doesn't get short compared to other libraries and it's super easy to understand ones you understand it.

## Tools used

The main tools I'm using are:
  - VS Code
  - Next.js
  - Chakra UI
  - Vercel (deploy website)
