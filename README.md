# My Blog

This is one hobby that I really wanted to develop mostly because I'm not good at communicate with a lot of people. Most of the times I prefer to stay quiet and don't say my opinion or even trying not to let people know about me. I'm not used to use Javascript (Js) nor Next.js or even using an UI tool such as Chakra UI, the main magic behind this webpage.

## Tools used

The main tools I'm using are:
  - VS Code
  - Next.js
  - Chakra UI
  - Vercel (deploy website)

And the main libraries used:
  - React Icons
  - Chakra-Icons

## How to use it?

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

## Notes

This example shows how to integrate the TypeScript type system into Next.js. Since TypeScript is supported out of the box with Next.js, all we have to do is to install TypeScript.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

To enable TypeScript's features, we install the type declarations for React and Node.

```
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

When we run `next dev` the next time, Next.js will start looking for any `.ts` or `.tsx` files in our project and builds it. It even automatically creates a `tsconfig.json` file for our project with the recommended settings.

Next.js has built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for Next.js' modules straight away.

A `type-check` script is also added to `package.json`, which runs TypeScript's `tsc` CLI in `noEmit` mode to run type-checking separately. You can then include this, for example, in your `test` scripts.
